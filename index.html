        What's worse is getting bitten by snakes. Snakes are very dangerous. They are slippery.
        I heard about a woman, in whose case snake went up her pants. You could imagine the things,
        oh the horror, she had to endure when snake charmer went after that snake.
        Charmer would get the snake out half-way, but then his lungs will deflate.
        As soon as he took a gulp of much needed air, snake will slip right in again.
        She had to pay him to make him keep doing so for next half an hour. Best day of her life.">Author @ Github</a> |
